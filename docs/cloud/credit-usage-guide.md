# üßÆ Refly Credits System Guide

This guide will help you understand Refly's credits system: what credits are used for, how to obtain them, consumption rules, package benefits, and early user retention benefits.

## üìå What are Credits?

Refly credits are a universal billing unit that can be used to call various AI models and features on the platform. You can think of credits as the "fuel" for AI usage ‚Äî each model call deducts corresponding credits based on consumption.

## üì• How to Obtain Credits

You can obtain credits through the following methods:

1. **Subscription Packages (Recommended)**
   - Each package includes daily credit refresh + monthly bonus credits
   - Package credits are universal for all models, no modality restrictions

2. **Individual Credit Packages (Coming Soon)**
   - Pay-as-you-go, more flexible for topping up

3. **Events / Friend Invitations (Coming Soon)**
   - Receive additional bonus credits through periodic events

## üí° Package Credit Rules

- Daily credits automatically refresh and do not accumulate to the next day
- Bonus credits are one-time distributions for advanced models or multimodal calls
- All credits can be viewed in transaction history and consumption details

## üë§ Legacy User Benefits
